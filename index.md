### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite since it automated many math processes in a
    single program. I learned how to write a program that completed those math
    processes by using many different functions to do so. We learned how to
    do simple calculations already, but this lab incorporated all of them into
    one output.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how to use
    conditional statements. I learned how to do everything with conditionals in
    this lab when we used else, else-if, and boolean statements. It was also
    interesting how there is no limit to the boolean statements that can be
    used in an if statement.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because of its introduction to object
    oriented programming. I learned how to use objects for the first time.
    Creating constructors for the class was very different from making any
    other type of function.
